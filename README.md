This script is a Blender add-on designed to simplify the process of creating materials that use multiple image textures, which can be particularly useful for 2D facial animation. Hereâ€™s how it works and why it's beneficial for Blender artists, especially those focused on 2D facial animation:

### Overview

**Purpose:**  
The add-on allows you to select multiple image textures from your computer, automatically creating a material in Blender that blends these images together. This is especially useful for 2D facial animation where different facial expressions or features (e.g., different eye shapes, mouth positions) can be layered and controlled within a single material.

### How It Helps in 2D Facial Animation

For 2D facial animation, artists often work with sprites or texture maps that represent different facial features or expressions. This add-on streamlines the process by:
- **Quickly Combining Multiple Expressions:** You can select various facial expressions and blend them in Blender, without manually setting up nodes.
- **Dynamic Control:** The node setup allows you to dynamically control which image (facial feature) is visible, making it easier to animate transitions between expressions.
- **Efficiency:** Automating the node creation process saves time and reduces errors, letting artists focus more on animation rather than technical setup.

### Practical Use

1. **Select Images:**  
   Go to the Material Properties tab in Blender. In the custom panel provided by this add-on, click on the button to select images. This opens a file dialog where you can choose multiple images that correspond to different facial features or expressions.

2. **Apply Material:**  
   After selecting your images, the add-on automatically creates a new material and applies it to the active object in your scene. The material comes with a node setup that allows for the blending and control of the selected images, making it easy to switch between different facial expressions or blend them together.

3. **Animate:**  
   With the material applied, you can now animate the visibility or blending of these textures using keyframes or drivers. This allows you to create smooth transitions between different facial expressions in your 2D animations.

This add-on is particularly useful for artists working on 2D characters in a 3D environment, where managing multiple facial expressions can be a complex task. It simplifies and automates the process, enabling faster and more flexible animation workflows.
